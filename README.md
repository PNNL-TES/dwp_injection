# dwp_injection

The repository contains code and some data for the Disney Wilderness Preserve (DWP) injection experiment.

This experiment uses soil cores taken from DWP in May 2013, and is designed to test the influence of variable saturation conditions on methane transmission and oxidation through a soil column, and to identify critical reaction zones.

The lead PI for this experiment is [Vanessa Bailey](http://www.pnl.gov/biology/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=5776).

This research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research (BER) as part of the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program](http://tes.science.energy.gov) and the Signature Discovery Initiative at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
