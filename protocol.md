#Experiment 1. Influence of variable saturation conditions on methane transmission and oxidation through a soil column; identification of critical reaction zones.**

When CH4 is generated in a soil, at locally anoxic sites, the percolation of the gas through the soil may encounter conditions where the gas is re-oxidized to CO2. This oxidation results in two mechanistic processes being unaccounted for, conceptually: the CH4 production processes may be underreported, and the biological oxidation of C substrates may be over-estimated. Thus, clarifying and accounting for this process in a soil column is necessary as a first step to accurately representing GHG production and emission from soils. 

The transmission and re-oxidation of methane through soil columns will be studied using 13CH4, introduced to the bottom of a soil column, and also at specific depths (to be defined by the soil structure), introduced via sampling ports embedded in the side of the column. All cores will be placed on ceramic pore plates set to regulate water potential from the bottom. A single large pulse of 13CH4 will be introduced as described and percolated through the soil at the start of the experiment. The quantity of CH4-C used will be a function of the gas fluxes observed in situ for the study soil; the 13C label will be 99%, ensuring the label is detectable at low C assimilation levels. The quantities of CO2 and CH4 emitted from the top of the core will be continuously monitored using the Picarro dual CO2-CH4 gas sampler. {may not happen…To permit a 13C-gas mass balance, gas samples will be directly analyzed from the Picarro to a capillary absorption spectrometer (CAS) with nano- to pico-molar 13C detection sensitivity, or collected in vacutainers at 8-hour intervals for 72 hours, then daily for two weeks.}  Cores will be replicated such that destructive analyses can be conducted daily for the first 72 h, and thereafter at the end of each week.

The water potential experienced by a soil can be closely correlated to the diameter of pore saturated at a given tension. By sampling pore water using different suction pressures, we can estimate the size of pores being drained.

Analyses at the destructive sampling events may include CT for characterization of the pore networks in each core, and identification of the saturated pore networks. The soil cores will be sliced open vertically, exposing the interior of the entire core for spatially-resolved analyses. One vertical section of the core will be interrogated using laser-ablation sampling (LA)- CAS or LA-atmospheric mass spectrometry (AMS), specifically targeting size-classes of macropore networks indicated as having been either saturated or unsaturated. The resulting LA-CAS generated “map” of 13C distribution will reveal locations where the labeled methane has been incorporated to native soil biomass. LA-AMS will provide information about the dominant chemical families (peptides, lipids, carbohydrates, oxidized or reduced C species) at these locations; if possible, coupling the CAS and AMS analyses will reveal the classes of organic molecules that have incorporated the 13C label. 

The other vertical section of the core will be sliced into depth sections that will be homogenized and analyzed using nanoDESI and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to more specifically characterize the nature of the C in each layer, and associated with the mineral components of the soils. Van Krevelen diagrams correlate chemical traits from all of the C molecules identified spectroscopically, and can be used to develop profiles of the types of organic molecules in the samples. Shifts in biomolecule distribution across depths and core types will provide information about the forms in which C occurs in soil, at both the different soluble phases, and at the mineral interfaces interrogated by nanoDESI, and may suggest hypotheses regarding the history of biological activity in those samples. This homogenized soil will also be diverted to subsequent small-scale batch incubations in which the further losses of freshly added 13C as GHGs are accounted for in a system with no soil physical structure. Microbial community DNA will be extracted from both the homogenized sample and from excised volumes of soil sampled from the non-homogenized cores. The contrast between the structure and diversity of the microbial community from the intact volume, and that of the homogenized soil will be used to develop new hypotheses about the distribution of microbial diversity in a three-dimensional system.

*Phase 8. Batch incubation*
